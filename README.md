# SpeechTrackingOnMobileDevice
I built an experiment that will be used on a mobile EEG device, it's Python version which gets to connect, synchronize and record session with a NetStation EEG Amp is being used in the Tata Lab at the University of Lethbridge.

In this experiment, a user would be presented with either speech or music segements and asked to rate the understanding or the familiarity, respectively.
